This version is built with Go 1.21.1 which contains some relevant security fixes for the html/template package, see Issue 62196 and Issue 62197. This is the main reason Hugo 0.119.0 is released sooner rather than later. But this release also comes with a dependency refresh and some useful image processing improvements:
A new general-purpose Process method and filter. A new Opacity filter.

This release is mostly motivated by the fix for the panic experienced by people having blackfriday configured as defaultMarkdownHandler (#9968). The Blackfriday support was removed in Hugo v0.100.0 after being deprecated with a warning for a long time.
v0.100.1 fix panic with markdownify/RenderString with shortcode on Page with no content file.
$page.RenderString (see #6703) finally supports shortcodes, and shortcode improvements is the main theme in Hugo 0.</description></item><item><title>Hugo Bootstrap Theme alpha</title><link>https://caiag.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed/post/hugo-bootstrap-theme/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 May 2022 13:35:02 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://caiag.github.io/hugo-mock-landing-page-autodeployed/post/hugo-bootstrap-theme/</guid><description>Hugo theme for a secure, blazing fast and SEO-ready static website, using Bootstrap 5.
